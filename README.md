# CS-300
**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**<br />
The problem that was solved in this course was needing to design a program to read from a CSV and to search and print SNHU courses and their prerequisites. <br/>
<br />
**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**<br />
I approached the problem by creating a program using a Binary Search Tree to store the SNHU courses. I chose a binary source tree over a vector or hash table because it was the best choice for alphabetic order and also due to the excellent processing time. <br />
<br />
**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**<br />
While working on this project, there were a few roadblocks that I encountered. If I got stuck trying to make an element work, I would first take a 15-minute break to clear my head. I then went back and watched the help videos provided and I reread the weekly reading materials. Then I would resume working on the program. <br />
<br />
**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**<br />
My work on this project has expanded my approach to developing programs in many ways. One important thing I learned is to make sure to thoroughly go through every option to find the best one. Sometimes it may be easier to design a code with certain aspects but that may not always be what is best for the program optimization or even the client. For example, in this project, it may have been easier to write a vector. However, the BST was the best choice. <br />
<br />
**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**<br />
One thing I learned on this project is how important it is to make sure things are modularized. This way aspects are easier to find, change, and keep up to date. Also, commenting is another extremely importing thing this project helped me to practice. Commenting helps a lot with keeping things organized and easy to find.
